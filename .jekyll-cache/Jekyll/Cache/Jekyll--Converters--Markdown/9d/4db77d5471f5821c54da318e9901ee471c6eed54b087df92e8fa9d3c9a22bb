I"f<p>I’m Eyad (E-add), a 21 year old computer science student at George Mason University.  I’m not really sure what I want todo but I’ve spent most of my time doing full-stack web development, devOps, and data science.  This is my blog where I ramble about tech I’ve messed with and other things I find interesting.</p>

<h3 id="srct">SRCT</h3>

<p>I joined Mason’s Student Run Computing and Technology in Fall 2016 and have been an active member since.
During this time I’ve become the project manager of What’s Open iOS, and helped create a working relationship with SRCT and Mason’s Auxiliary Enterprises.  In this relationship, the Auxiliary Enterprises makes use of our What’s Open website as their official manner to display hours for locations around campus, and we maintain What’s Open.  Auxiliary Enterprises also advertises the iOS, Android, and webpage on their advertising material around campus.</p>

<p>I am also the system administrator for SRCT.
As system administrator I am tasked with maintaing all our infrastructure, which includes managing our GitLab instance.  I also am responsible for deploying projects and ensuring there are no active CVEs in production.  I am currently working with the rest of the SRCT Exec board and Volgenau School of Engineering to move SRCT’s infrastructure into the Engineering schools lab.</p>
