## What is leetcode?

It's basically impossible to be in the tech field without hearing about Leetcode.  With many software interviews requiring the completion of a code assessment, it's the first place most of us look when trying to prepare.  With a large repository of programming challenges it's become somewhat of a holy grail for those on the job hunt.  

## My adventure with leetcode

Before a couple weeks ago, I had never really used leetcode.  I made it through every interview without ever really needing a coding assessment (except google).  When I started applying for new jobs at the start of the year, I found myself realizing that if I wanted to work at any of these big tech companies, I would likely have to-do a code assessment.  In preperation, I finally hopped on the leetcode train and started drilling.

Every night I spent about one to two hours a night working through questions.  Anything I didn't understand, there would be a youtube video that'd explain the question, give some sort of visual to demonstrate the algorithm, then, of course, provide the code for the solution.  The combination of the videos + the questions helped me refresh up on important algorithms and data structures that I haven't really used since graduating college.  

My schedule for about a week and a half was work -> leetcode -> gym -> sleep.  Everyday I'd get home from the work and spend a couple hours working through leetcode problems while having dinner.  In hindsight, it wasn't the most optimal schedule, with my freetime being taken up by leetcode or going to the gym.  The feeling of burnout after about a week was real.  It could've been I wasn't really used to that kind of _grind_ anymore, having finished college almost two years ago and having other hobbies I like to enjoy after I finish up a day of work, it became increasingly difficult to keep practicing.  If you're someone who does leetcode style problems on a regular basis, either for fun or as a method of keeping up certain skills, you probably don't need to commit to a grind like that.  However, I was trying to review up on a lot of concepts in a fairly short amount of time, so doing leetcode style problems at my leasure wasn't really an option.  

All in all it worked out.  I had my first coding assessment recently, and the prep work I did through leetcode questions ended up helping my out a ton.  While the questions didn't necessarily require anything crazy, simply reviewing _how_ to break down that style of question, as well as being familar with more efficient ways to manipulate arrays, strings, and other data structures let me to focus more time on what the question wanted, and less time trying to figure out how to implement it.
