I'm Eyad (E-add), a 24 year old Software Engineer.  I enjoy creating new things, and coming up with solutions to difficult problems.  I currently work as a DevOps engineer, automating the boring stuff so we can spend more time on what's fun, but in my free time I simply go where the wind takes me.  I'm always up for a challenge, and always willing to learn new things!
